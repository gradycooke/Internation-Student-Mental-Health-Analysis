# International Student Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project investigating the relationship between length of stay and mental health outcomes among international university students. Using SQL for data querying and Python for visualization, the analysis explores trends across three psychological assessments: depression (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS).

## Key Analysis Areas
- Grouped analysis of mental health scores by length of stay
- Trends in depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress over time
- Visualization of raw and standardized scores to compare across assessments
- Use of SQL to structure and extract meaningful group statistics

## Tools & Libraries
- PostgreSQL (via SQLite in notebook)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy (for z-score normalization)

## Goal
To examine whether length of stay is associated with changes in mental health indicators among international students and explore whether patterns in the data align with existing psychological research.
